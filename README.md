# Out-of-bounds List Access in Dart Async Operation

This repository demonstrates a potential error in Dart code when asynchronously fetching and processing JSON data.  The code attempts to access elements of a JSON array without proper error handling for cases where the array might be empty or elements may be missing.

**The bug:** The code accesses `data[0]['name']` assuming the JSON array (`data`) is not empty and always contains an element with the 'name' key.  If the API response is unexpected, this will throw an exception.

**The solution:**  The solution adds robust checks to handle the various potential issues that could occur during data access, ensuring that the code handles unexpected responses gracefully and avoids index-out-of-bounds exceptions.
